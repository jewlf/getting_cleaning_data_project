=============================

Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data class project

This project derives a "tiny data set" containing the averaged values
collected from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers.

The foundation data was collected as part of the project:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

And was obtained from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

R script "run_analysis.R" was used to generate the tiny data set file, "tinydata.txt".

It should be noted that "run_analysis.R" is very verbose in that it contains many
internal comments, and commented out commands, that can be used when manually running
the script.  Intermediate data frames are left intact for checking that the code
is working as intended.
